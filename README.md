# galactic-asteroid-belt

## Overview
A simple game that I created as a way to teach myself Go.  Enjoy!

## Run
To run, you will need Go 1.17 installed, then just clone the repo and run from root:
```
go run .
```

## Instructions

Primary controls are:

**Space Bar** or **Left Mouse Click** to increase ship height.  Gravity will cause the ship to fall.  You must balance out the upward and downward movement to move through the course, all while avoiding asteroids.

Otherwise follow onscreen prompts.

Avoid Hitting:
- The top/bottom rock boundaries
- The random spires
- The asteroids

Hit a star to get a temporary speed boost and shield.  

The game speed will increase as you make it further.  Have fun!
